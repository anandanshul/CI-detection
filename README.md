# 🧠 PPG Signal Analysis using Fuzzy GRU for Cerebral Infarction Detection

This project presents a complete pipeline for analyzing PPG (Photoplethysmogram) signals using entropy-based features and a novel Fuzzy GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network. The aim is to assist in the early diagnosis of cerebral infarction and classification of therapy types using AI-driven methods.

## 🔬 Project Highlights

- 💡 Combines traditional signal processing with advanced deep learning
- 📊 Achieved **91% accuracy** in cerebral infarction prediction
- 🧠 Achieved **85% accuracy** in therapy classification
- ⚙️ Built on a custom Fuzzy GRU architecture that incorporates fuzzy logic into the GRU cell
- 📈 Focuses on entropy feature extraction (e.g., Shannon, Permutation, Spectral Entropy) to capture the complexity of PPG signals

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Preprocessing
- Denoising raw PPG signals using bandpass filters
- Normalizing and segmenting time windows

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Shannon Entropy  
- Permutation Entropy  
- Spectral Entropy  
- Sample Entropy  

### 3. Fuzzy GRU Network
A GRU architecture infused with fuzzy membership functions to improve interpretability and adaptivity of learning across ambiguous patterns in biomedical data.
